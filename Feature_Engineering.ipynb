        "1. What is a parameter?\n",
        "A parameter is a variable in a model that is learned from data during training. In machine learning, parameters are internal configuration values (like weights in linear regression or neural networks) that the algorithm adjusts to minimize error.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is correlation?\n",
        "Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the degree to which two variables move in relation to each other. It is typically measured with a correlation coefficient (like Pearson’s), which ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. For example, if hours of TV watched goes up and exam scores go down, they are negatively correlated.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
        "Machine Learning (ML) is a field of computer science that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.\n",
        "Main components:\n",
        "Data: The input for training and testing.\n",
        "Model: The algorithm that learns patterns from the data.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        "The loss value quantifies the difference between the predicted values and actual values. A lower loss indicates the model is making more accurate predictions. If the loss is high, the model is performing poorly.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "Continuous variables: Numeric values with infinite possibilities within a range (e.g., height, weight).\n",

        "8. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        "Training set: The part of data used to train the model.\n",
        "Testing set: Data the model hasn’t seen before, used to evaluate performance. This ensures the model can generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        "sklearn.preprocessing is a module in Scikit-learn (a popular ML library in Python) that provides functions for scaling, encoding, normalizing, and transforming data before feeding it into a model.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
        "You can use train_test_split from Scikit-learn:\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
        "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is essential before modeling because it helps you:\n",
        "Understand the data: Know the structure, distributions, and relationships.\n",
        "Detect anomalies: Identify outliers, missing values, or inconsistent data.\n",
        "Choose the right model: Some models require assumptions (e.g., normality, linearity).\n",
        "Select relevant features: Know which variables are important or redundant.\n",
        "Improve performance: Cleaning and transforming data leads to better model results\n",
        "\n",

        "Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the degree to which two variables move in relation to each other.\n",

        "+1: perfect positive correlation\n",

        "-1: perfect negative correlation\n",

        "13. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases.\n",
