        "Q 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. These objects combine data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit. OOP is built on four main principles: encapsulation (hiding internal details), inheritance (reusing code through parent-child relationships), polymorphism (using the same interface for different underlying forms), and abstraction (simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential features). It helps make code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It has the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) defined in its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "Abstraction is about what an object does,&\n",
        "Encapsulation is about how it hides its data and internal workings\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 5.  What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Dunder methods provide a powerful way to define how objects of your class interact with the built-in Python operations, making them more flexible and integrated into Python's features\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a concept where a class (called a child or subclass) can inherit properties and behaviors (methods and attributes) from another class (called a parent or superclass)\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) means \"many forms\", and it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface (like a method name) to behave differently based on the object it is acting upon.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting direct access to an object's internal data and methods, and instead using public methods (getters/setters) to access or modify that data. This helps protect the internal state of the object and promotes better control and security.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "A constructor is a special method called when an object is created. In Python, it’s the __init__ method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "class methods and static methods are special types of methods that behave differently from regular instance methods. They're defined using decorators: @classmethod and @staticmethod.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "Method overloading in Python means having a method that can do different things based on the arguments you pass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "in OOP, method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that’s already defined in its superclass\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "The @property decorator in Python is used to turn a method into a getter — so you can access it like an attribute, without using parentheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as if they were the same type through a common interface (like a parent class or method name)\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be inherited. It can have abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be overridden in child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) makes coding easier by organizing code into objects and classes. It allows reusing code through inheritance, protecting data using encapsulation, and writing flexible code with polymorphism. OOP also makes programs more organized, easier to update, and maintain, especially for large projects\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "Class Variable- Shared across all instances & Instance Variable- Unique to each instance of the class\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "Multiple inheritance in Python refers to a class inheriting from more than one parent class. This allows a child class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple classes, making it possible to combine functionality from different sources\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "Use __str__ for a nice, human-readable string & Use __repr__ for a detailed, unambiguous string, typically for debugging\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "The super() function allows you to-\n",
        "Call methods from the parent class, Avoid explicitly referencing the parent class, making the code more flexible, Ensure proper method resolution, especially in complex class hierarchies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "The __del__ method is used for cleaning up resources when an object is destroyed, but its use is typically reserved for situations where manual cleanup is required. Python's garbage collection system calls it automatically when an object is about to be destroyed\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "Use @staticmethod when the method doesn't need access to the class or instance, and is logically tied to the class.\n",
        "Use @classmethod when the method needs to modify or access class-level attributes or methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "Polymorphism in Python allows different classes to provide their own implementation of the same method, and the correct method is called based on the object type. This makes code more flexible, reusable, and extensible\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "Method chaining is a technique in Python OOP where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line, and each method returns the object itself. This leads to more concise, readable, and expressive code\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a function. This gives the object function-like behavior while still allowing it to maintain its own state and attributes."
